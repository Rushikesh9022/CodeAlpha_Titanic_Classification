Titanic Classification Project
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Titanic classification task, which is part of my Data Science internship at CODEALPHA. The goal of this project is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on features such as passenger class and gender.

Project Steps
Importing Libraries

Essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning are imported.
Importing the Dataset

The Titanic dataset is loaded from a CSV file and initial rows are inspected to understand its structure.
Data Exploration

Basic data exploration is performed to get insights into the dataset, including its shape and statistical summary.
Handling Missing Values

Identified missing values in the 'Age' column. The column is dropped in this instance to simplify preprocessing.
Data Visualization

Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of survivors across different passenger classes and genders.
Data Preprocessing

Categorical variables, such as gender, are encoded into numerical values using label encoding.
Dropping Non-required Columns

Non-essential columns, specifically 'Age', are dropped to clean the dataset.
Model Training

The dataset is split into features (X) and target (Y) variables. A Logistic Regression model is then trained on the training data.
Model Prediction

Predictions are made on the test data. An example prediction for specific input values demonstrates practical application of the model.
